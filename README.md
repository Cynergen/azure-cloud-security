# Azure Cloud Security Project

This project demonstrates detection engineering, monitoring, and cloud security practices in Azure using Go, C++, and Terraform.

## Project Structure

- **go-code/**: Contains Go code for integrating with Splunk for security monitoring and incident response.
- **cplusplus-code/**: Contains C++ code for interacting with the Azure Security API.
- **terraform-code/**: Contains Terraform configuration for automating infrastructure setup and monitoring in Azure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (version X.X or later)
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Terraform (version X.X or later)
- Azure CLI
- Splunk CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cynergen/azure-cloud-security.git
   cd azure-cloud-security


  This is a project that will assist you in providing elements of detection engineering strategies specifically for azure cloud environments. It will enclose specific responsibilities in the projects that will be presented and some of the challenges that you are likely to face during this implementation.

  Follow the steps and use the technologies that are demonstrated for more effective measures within the strategies presented.
  I will be using real life scenarios that will assist you in real work world situations.

 Giving you the the upper hand when it comes to these implemented detection engineering strategies below.

 First you want to start off with a thourough assessment of the curent security landscape in our Azure cloud environment identifying gaps and sections for improvement. Once that has been discovered create a detection engineering strategies that aligns with the deployment of Azure-native security tools along with integration of third party siems soultions, be aware of  the creation of custom detction rules. I am using terrraform to automate the deployment of these tools and integrate them into our CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous monitoring and updating.

 implentation should lead to a fifty percent reduction in the time it takes to detect and response to threats.
